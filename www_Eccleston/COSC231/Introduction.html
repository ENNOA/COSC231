        <h5 style="margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;">I am Jaison Eccleston. I recently bought a house in Dexter with my wife. I went to high school in Muskegon Michigan and lived in Grand Rapids for a few years before moving back to this area. Currently I work full time in Biomedical Engineering.
            This is my third computer science class. I've taken COSC 111 and 211 with Dr. Tehranipour. They were fun and I hope this will be as well.</h5>

        <h2 style="color: #E38E48"><b><i>Interests &#38; Hobbies:</i></b></h2>
        <h5 style="margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;">These are things I like to do when I have free time:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><h5 style="margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;">I enjoy playing <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">Dungeons and Dragons.</a> I run a game with coworkers and occasionally write Java programs to assist in running the game and practice coding skills.</h5></li>
                <li><h5 style="margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;">I also practice martial arts. I have a black belt in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokan"> Shotokan Karate </a> and Sei too Ryu Kenjutsu.</h5></li>
                <li><h5 style="margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;">I collect comic books. So far, I have collected over 2,000 issues from Marvel, DC (mostly Batman), and Image Comics.</h5></li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color: #E38E48"><b><i>Goals &#38; Dreams:</i></b></h2>
        <h5 style="margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Originally, I planned on majoring in Chemistry, but I recently changed my mind and decided to Major in Computer Science instead. I am working towards either Computer Science [BA] or Applied Computer Science [BS]. I also plan on getting a Minor in Chemistry so that those classes do not go to waste.
            I enjoy studying martial arts and would like to study more. I would like to learn more about European sword martial arts as well as other styles of karate. I would also like to learn Filipino martial arts like Escrima.
